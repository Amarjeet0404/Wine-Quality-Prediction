## Wine Quality Prediction Project

### Problem Statement:
Develop a machine learning model to predict the quality of wine based on physiochemical features.

### Objective:
To improve wine production processes and increase sales by accurately predicting wine quality.

### Dataset:
The Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository contains 1599 rows and 12 attributes including physiochemical properties of red and white vinho verde wines from Portugal.

### Methodology:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzed dataset for outliers, correlations, and quality distribution.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Removed missing values, duplicates, and scaled data.
3. **Feature Selection and Engineering**: Selected relevant features and eliminated highly correlated ones.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Utilized Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest classifiers.
5. **Model Optimization**: Tuned hyperparameters to improve accuracy.

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

### Results:
- Decision Tree Classifier: 94.7% accuracy
- Support Vector Classifier: 74.4% accuracy
- Random Forest Classifier: 95.3% accuracy

### Limitations:
1. Limited dataset size.
2. Limited feature diversity.
3. Subjective nature of wine quality assessment.

### Future Research Directions:
1. Expand dataset.
2. Analyze additional wine types.
3. Incorporate sensory data.
4. Consider regional differences and pricing.
